# JY-ME01

VitaSmart JY-ME01 Angle Sensor Arduino Library

The library encapsulates a function that can be used to obtain the current angle value of the angle sensor via serial MODBUS communication.

Of course, it is necessary to open the serial port connected to the angle sensor, select the right baud rate, and then execute the initialisation procedure.

Please refer to the routine "modbus_test.cpp" for more information.
